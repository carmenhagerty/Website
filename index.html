      <h1 style="color:#478023 ; font-family:Lucida Console">What is The MyPlant Sensor?</h1>
      <p style="color:white ; font-family:Lucida Console">This is a sensor for various plants that can sense water, pH, sunlight, and temperature. Using our sensor will help you better understand the health of your plant, as well as it's needs.</p>
      <h1 style="color:#478023 ; font-family:Lucida Console">Our Mission</h1>
      <p style="color:white ; font-family:Lucida Console">Often times it's frustrating that 70% of carbon emissions come from large companies. And it feels like there is little that individuals can do to improve the environment. One simple step that people can take is growing more plants. However, it can be complicated to grow healthy, lasting plants. To encourage others to grow more plants, we decided to create the MyPlant sensor. The goal of this sensor project is to create an easier way for people to keep plants alive and healthy. It can be difficult to understand why a plant is not living to its full potential, but with our sensor the process is easy and simplified.
